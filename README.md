  ~code_book.md describes each variables and its values in the tidy data set and all the steps I use to clean up the data.
  
  ~run_analysis.R saved the r scripts that followed by the project requirements:
      1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
      3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
      5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
      
  ~final_data.txt is the exported final data
  
  ~code_book explain the variables and steps on how I clean up the original dataset
